# Titanic Survival Prediction - Practice Project

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using the famous Titanic dataset. The prediction model is built using a Random Forest algorithm. This project serves as a practice exercise to demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques for binary classification tasks.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset is widely used in the field of machine learning. It contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including their age, gender, ticket class, fare, and whether they survived or not. The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set, with the training set containing the survival labels.
